# Training App (Mobile)

This is a minimal Expo-style scaffold for the Trainer Booking & Training Management mobile app.

Run locally:

```powershell
cd mobile
npm install
# then
npx expo start
```

Notes:
- The backend API used by the mobile app is `http://localhost:5000/api/auth` (update `mobile/services/api.js` if needed).
- This scaffold uses simple placeholder screens; integrate real booking flows, availability calendar, and push notifications as next steps.
